## Coding conventions

The project implements `eslint`, a javascript linter to set pattern and code rules to be more readible. Once you read the code, you will notice how it is built it.

- Tabs for indentation
- A unix linebreak style.
- Single quotes for strings.
- No semicolon. :happy:
- The `if` conditions of one line must be used with ternary operator.

Also, it uses `editorconfig`, a file format to maintain a coding style. You must install `editorconfig` in your code editor. Based on which editor you are using, it could be you already have it installed. I will suggest check his website [here](https://editorconfig.org/).
